ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to the Huberman Lab podcast
where we discuss science
and science- based
tools for everyday life.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine.
Today is an Ask Me
Anything episode or AMA.
This is part of our
premium subscriber channel.
Our premium subscriber
channel was started in order
to provide support for
the standard Huberman Lab
podcast, which comes
out every Monday
and is available at
zero cost to everybody
on all standard feeds, YouTube,
Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere.
We also started the
premium channel as a way
to generate support for
exciting research being
done at Stanford and elsewhere.
Research on human
beings that leads
to important
discoveries that assist
mental health, physical
health, and performance.
I'm also pleased to inform
you that for every dollar
of the Huberman
Lab Premium channel
generates for research
studies, the Tiny Foundation
has agreed to match
that amount, so now we
are able to double the
total amount of funding
given to studies of mental
health, physical health,
and human performance.
And now without further ado,
I will answer your questions.
And as always, I
will strive to be
as thorough as possible,
as clear as possible,
and as concise as possible.
Our first question is about
abstaining from thoughts,
and in answering
this question, we're
going to skirt right
up against a topic
that I've covered before
on the podcast which
is obsessive compulsive
disorder, which
is a very serious disorder.
I mean, it can have
a range of severity,
but people with true
OCD suffer a lot
from obsessions, these
are intrusive thoughts,
and compulsions, which are the
behaviors typically associated
with those thoughts.
I think it's really
important that we define
OCD really clearly so
that we can make sure
that we're talking
about intrusive thoughts
and the desire to abstain
from thoughts versus OCD
and where there might
be some overlap there.
The functional definition
of OCD that really pertains
to the disorder, obsessive
compulsive disorder,
OCD as opposed to we
call people neurotic,
or we say you have
OCD, or I'm so
OCD about this,
or OCD about that,
that's become a common
use of the acronym OCD.
But true OCD is a
situation in which
engaging in a particular
compulsive behavior
does not serve to reduce the
intensity or the frequency
of the obsessions.
In fact, it makes it worse.
So the typical thing
that we hear these days
is oh, you're so OCD, or
he's so OCD, or she's so OCD,
or I'm so OCD.
Now if someone is OCD in
that sense, OK, so not
the clinical disorder
but OCD in the sense
that they're really clean,
they're really fastidious,
they need everything perfect.
However, that person can achieve
some level of calm and comfort
that's fairly long
lasting if everything
is clean and perfect,
well, then that's not
obsessive compulsive disorder.
This is really
important to understand
as we venture into
answering the question
about intrusive
thoughts and the desire
to abstain from
certain thoughts.
A person with true OCD will
keep cleaning and cleaning,
or washing their hands,
or arranging things
at perfect right angles,
but the more they
do it, the more their
anxiety goes up.
A person who has more typical,
gosh, we don't really even
have a language for this
nowadays unfortunately,
but the sort of person that's
extremely particular, they need
things a certain way, and
they're very driven to resolve
things and do things to make
sure that things are done
in a certain way, or
handled in a certain way,
well, if that person
can experience relief
from engaging in let's say,
exercise, or from cleaning,
you'd say you're so
OCD about exercise.
Well, but if exercising for
an hour or even two hours
in the morning makes somebody
really calm the rest of the day
and they don't need to
exercise, well, then
they're not
necessarily true OCD.
They don't necessarily have a
disorder related to exercise.
However, if they're exercising
for two hours in the morning
and then they find
they can't concentrate
on other things and their desire
to exercise just increases
and increases and becomes
intrusive for them disrupting
their quality of life
throughout the day,
well, then that's falling
under the umbrella of what
we would call a true disorder.
So we want to highlight
that because the question is
about a desire to
abstain from thoughts,
and the question is,
in your discussion
with Dr. Anna Lembke--
I should just mention
Dr. Anna Lembke
is the director of our Dual
Diagnosis Addiction Clinic
at Stanford University
School of Medicine.
She's the author of this
incredible book Dopamine Nation
that I think
everybody should read.
I do believe everyone
should read that book.
So important for the
addict and nonaddict
alike because it deals with
basically the state of our life
nowadays.
We're living in this
dopamine rich world
where we can quickly become
dopamine depleted, which
is terrible, leads to
depression in addition to things
like addiction in
some folks, et cetera.
Anna was a guest on the podcast.
You can find her episode
at hubermanlab.com.
Just put Anna.
I think she's the only
guest we've had this far
whose name is Anna, so
it'll just pop up there.
The entire website
is searchable.
But if you want to
listen to that episode
or watch that episode, you can
access it at hubermanlab.com.
The question is
in your discussion
with Dr. Anna Lembke you
were talking about abstaining
from people's drug
of choice for 30 days
to reset the dopamine
reward pathway.
And indeed that is the
prescriptive that Dr. Anna
Lembke gives for
most all addictions
and for people that are
suffering from mild or even
severe depression
related to dopamine
seeking behaviors, social
media, video games sex, food,
et cetera.
However, of course, in
the instance of food
or in some other addictions,
you can't abstain for 30 days.
That would be terrible to
abstain for food for 30 days.
I'm sure people have done it,
but it is not healthy to do.
Certain things like
alcohol and drugs people
can abstain for
30 days in efforts
to never go back to them again.
There are cases of
severe alcohol or opiate
dependence where people can't go
cold turkey or they risk dying,
so there they need to really
work with a physician.
But the 30-day reset
of the dopamine system
is something that's
very real, and that
pertains to most people.
That is it's going to be
very effective for most
people struggling with
either behavioral,
or what are sometimes
called process addictions,
or other types of addictions
including substance abuse
issues.
The question continues.
You said you were
going to ask Anna
how to abstain if
your drug of choice
is a thought or
narrative as opposed
to a substance or a behavior.
The question continues,
as far as I can tell,
your discussion
with Anna moved on
before you asked
her the question.
Would you be able to
discuss strategies
for abstaining from addictive
thoughts and narratives?
OK, so let's talk about
intrusive thoughts,
and let's start off by asking
ourselves, what is a thought?
In the realm of
neurobiology, we have
sensations which are the
processes by which our neurons,
nerve cells convert light,
photons, sound waves, touch,
mechanical pressure, et
cetera into electrical signals
and chemical signals that
head into our nervous system,
including our brain.
And then our brain at least
we think, make sense of them,
and help us navigate
the world that we're in.
So the sensation part
is a pure transformation
of mechanical information,
or in some cases,
chemical information like smell.
Literally, volatile chemicals
floating around in the world
are brought in through
your nose and your neurons
and your olfactory
bulb convert those
into electrical and
chemical signals
that your brain can understand.
Perceptions are your idea
of what those signals out
in the world are.
Either because you're
paying attention
to them, or for some
other reason you decide
that a stop sign in
front of you is red,
and that the sign
behind it is white,
and that the sky is blue or
cloudy, those are perceptions.
So we have sensations
and perceptions.
Then we have emotions
which are these things that
include the mind and
body that are related
to neuromodulators like
dopamine, serotonin, et cetera,
although, those chemicals
do other things as well.
And then, of course, we
have behaviors, actions.
Everything from me moving
my pen on a piece of paper
to walking, running, et cetera.
Thoughts are a fifth
category of neural
functioning that we
really need to define,
but that doesn't have
as strict a definition
as sensations, perceptions,
or feeling, or action.
But thoughts are real.
We all know this.
Thoughts are real.
And one way that we
can define thoughts
is thoughts are perceptions
that include data
from the past, present,
or future, or combinations
of past and present, or present
and future, or future and past.
I'm not trying to give an overly
complicated definition here,
but if we are going to
answer a question about how
to abstain from
thoughts in a really
direct and actionable
way, we really
need to address
what are thoughts.
So thoughts are perceptions
that are generated internally.
We don't need any
external sensation
in order to have a thought.
We can close our eyes.
We could be in sensory
isolation for that matter.
We could even be
floating with no gravity,
and we can have a thought.
Thoughts tend to run pretty much
automatically in the background
all the time.
Some people refer
to this as chatter
in the back of our minds
in a very unstructured way.
And then if we
force our thoughts
to be structured because
we decide they need to be,
or if something
in our environment
captures our perception,
then our thoughts
tend to be structured.
Let me give you an example.
If I'm just walking
around, if there
were a way in which
we could broadcast
my thoughts onto a screen,
I hope we wouldn't do that.
But those thoughts
would be a mixture
of semi-complete
sentences and gibberish.
However, if somebody
stops me and says, hi.
Good to see you.
What are you doing today?
And I start answering,
well, then my thoughts
are suddenly being driven
by an external stimulus,
their question, and some
internal ideas, memory
of who I am and what
I'm doing that day so
past and present, and so on.
And so thoughts
become structured.
So when we have a question about
how to abstain from thoughts,
we need to be
additionally specific
and really pinpoint that
what we're trying to do
is to abstain from thoughts we
don't want presumably, either
because they are too
repetitive and distracting,
or because what's contained in
those thoughts is disturbing.
This is important because
it gives us two answers
to the questions that
are highly divergent.
One answer to the
question of how
to abstain from intrusive
thoughts, thoughts that we're
addicted to, is if those
thoughts are merely
on loop all the time
and we can't stop them,
but the thoughts themselves
aren't particularly disturbing.
So think about a song you
can't get out of your head,
or you keep
recounting some event,
but the event itself
isn't very disturbing.
It's just intrusive
because it's there.
Well, in that case,
the data really
point to trying to
anchor your thoughts
to some external stimulus.
So getting into action,
getting into activities
that really draw your attention
away from that thought.
Now you may still hear it
scrolling in the background,
so you might be sitting in
class still hearing that loop
of thoughts in the background.
That's something that
over time ought to wane,
it ought to disappear
if we try and bring
more and more attention
to whatever it
is that's in our
environment, whatever
it is that we happen to be
learning, or doing physically,
et cetera.
Things like mindful meditation.
Doing a 10 or even
just 5 minutes
a day practice of
sitting with eyes closed,
or lying down with eyes
closed and really focusing
on one's breath, focusing
one's attention on sometimes
called the third eye
center, but in science we'd
say just the region right
behind the forehead,
you're directing
your attention there,
has been shown to increase
focus for singular topics
and can improve memory and do a
bunch of other things as well.
Those are data from Dr. Wendy
Suzuki's lab at New York
University.
She was a guest on
the podcast as well.
My laboratory has run studies
on mindful meditation as well.
So what you're
really trying to do
is learn how to focus
better on one thing,
and by focusing
on that one thing,
you focus off these
repetitive thoughts.
Now, I have a feeling that
this question was asked
and that many people
upvoted this question
because the issue isn't
just thoughts that
are intrusive because
they're there and on repeat,
but because the thoughts
themselves are actually
troubling.
This could be recounting a
trauma, someone harmed you,
you observed something that was
disturbing, you felt wronged,
you felt someone
else was wronged,
you can't seem to get
your mind off of something
and your emotions
tend to follow,
and so it's uncomfortable.
I have a feeling this is
the root of the question.
In that case, the approach
is very different.
What we know from essentially
all of the quality
scientific and
clinical studies is
that those sorts of
intrusive thoughts
are very much like a trauma.
Now we have to be clear in
defining what trauma is.
I'll use the definition
that Dr. Paul
Conti, another incredible
guest that was on our podcast.
A Stanford-Harvard
trained psychiatrist.
I think one of the
world's foremost leaders
on the issue of trauma and
psychiatry and psychology
generally.
He defines trauma as an event
or something that fundamentally
changes the way that your
nervous system works such
that you function less
adaptively going forward
from that event.
So not every bad occurrence
in your life is a trauma.
That's good news.
The bad news is many
people have traumas,
and traumas change the way
that our nervous system
works so that we don't
function as well as we could.
So in that sense, intrusive
thoughts that are disturbing
are in many ways traumas and
are reinforcing that trauma.
Now, we know that almost
counterintuitively
in order to deal
with trauma, you
have to get very
close to that trauma.
You don't have to
reexpose, and I
would hope you would
not reexpose yourself
to the very same trauma.
But we know that one of the
best ways to deal with traumas
is to get very clear about the
narrative around those traumas.
Now this can be done
with a therapist ideally,
but not everyone has access to
therapy or can afford therapy.
There's a range of quality of
therapists for that matter,
so we're always referring
to the desire for people
to do great therapy
with really great,
meaning excellent
and trained people.
But it turns out that if you
want to extinguish an intrusive
thought, one of the
best ways to do that
is to journal about that
particular thought extensively.
So rather than the earlier
strategy for intrusive thoughts
where they're just on
loop, and intrusive
because they're on
loop and present,
but their content
isn't disturbing,
when a thought is
disturbing and intrusive,
we know that it's very
useful to script out
as much detail about
that particular thought
and the things around
it as possible.
Now obviously, you want
to do this in a way that
is fairly structured.
So you ideally would
use complete sentences.
So the reason for doing
that is that thoughts,
as I mentioned earlier,
can often be fragmentary,
so they pop up in our mind
almost seemingly spontaneously.
They're inhibiting
our ability to focus,
or be present at work, or
family, or other things,
or sleep.
Writing things down
in a lot of detail
does seem to have this
quality of both reducing
the emotional load of whatever
it is that thought is about,
as well as diminishing the
frequency of those intrusive
thoughts over time.
So this is far and away
different than the strategy
I mentioned for the other
types of intrusive thoughts.
And really it's far
and away different
from the 30-day
abstinence approach
that Dr. Anna Lembke was
talking about for substance
or behavioral addictions.
Now, of course, this process
of abstaining from thoughts
or removing the addictive
nature of certain thoughts
can definitely take some time.
So a good example there
would be superstitions.
I'll come clean
here, and I've talked
about this before
on a few podcasts
that when I was in
college, I developed
a knock on wood superstition.
Any time I'd say something that
I didn't want to happen or did
want to happen, I'd say, knock
on wood, and I'd knock on wood.
And then I started suppressing
the behavior mostly
because it was a
little embarrassing.
And then I started just
telling myself in my head,
knock on wood, knock
on wood, knock on wood.
And it was clearly a little
bit of an OCD type thing,
but again, OCD in
air quotes here.
I think it qualified
as OCD in the sense
that the more I did it,
the more I wanted to do it.
So I needed to go cold
turkey on the thinking,
but how can you go cold
turkey on a thought?
You couldn't.
What I was told to do and
what worked very well for me
was to just write down
the worst possible outcome
that I was concerned about.
So to really get close to the
nature or the underlying basis
of that intrusive thought.
And I raise this
because a lot of times
the intrusive thought
is not, OK, I'm
thinking about a
car accident, or I'm
thinking about a breakup, or
I'm thinking about an exam
that I have.
That can be intrusive,
but a lot of times
it's some kind of
nebulous, abstract,
set of words, or ideas,
or images around something
that happened that we saw,
or heard, or experienced.
And by putting a lot
of clear structure
to what the thought is exactly
and to putting some thought
and structure onto paper
about what that pattern of not
healthy thinking
relates to, people often
achieve tremendous relief in
a fairly short amount of time.
Sometimes just in one
session of writing it down,
sometimes they need to write
it down multiple times.
What you're essentially trying
to do with a intrusive thought
or a trauma of
any kind is you're
trying to turn a disturbing
story, that is a story that
evokes a lot of
emotion and captures,
it hijacks your nervous system,
into what is essentially
a known but repetitive
and old, boring story
where the emotional
load has been depleted.
And there are, of course, I
have to highlight the fact
that getting sufficient rapid
eye movement sleep we also know
is very important for
removing the emotional load
of traumatic experiences
and intrusive thoughts.
So you really want to strive to
get the best possible sleep you
can that includes sufficient
rapid eye movement sleep.
And we have multiple
zero-cost resources
for that at hubermanlab.com.
We have the episode
on mastery of sleep.
We have the episode
on perfect your sleep.
We have the toolkit for sleep.
All of which are time
stamped and all of which
can be accessed completely
zero-cost to try and get
your sleep as good as
possible, including lots
of rapid eye movement sleep.
So in order to remove intrusive
and addictive thoughts,
ask yourself, is this
OCD of the classic sense?
If it is, you should
see a psychiatrist.
They won't necessarily
prescribe medication,
but there are tools
for true OCD that are
very effective in many cases.
And we did the episode
on OCD which I invite
you to listen to as well.
You want to ask yourself,
are the thoughts
disturbing or merely
intrusive and repetitive?
If they're merely intrusive
and repetitive, well,
then learning to focus your
attention on other things
and getting better at
focusing on single things
through an exercise
like mindfulness,
meditation can really help.
And indeed perhaps the best
use of mindfulness meditation
is to improve your
level of focus.
It does have other
benefits as well,
but that's going to be the major
one that one will experience
even with these very short 5
or 10-minute day meditations.
Great data on that from
the scientific literature.
And then if those intrusive
thoughts are not only intrusive
but they're also
disturbing, in that case,
you really want to put as
much structure and thought,
believe it or not, into
what those thoughts are
really about.
Write them out on paper
in complete sentences
and maybe do that multiple
times until the underlying
emotions related
to those thoughts
really start to diminish.
And by doing that,
you're essentially
doing your own form
of trauma therapy,
for lack of a better
way to put it.
And again, the data
really point to the fact
that getting close to
the specific details
around those
intrusive thoughts is
going to be the best
way to extinguish them.
The next question is about
continuous glucose monitors
or CGMs.
There's a lot of interest
in CGMs these days
because they've recently
become commercially available,
whereas previously, you had
to get them from a physician,
or you had to have diabetes in
order to get one or wear one.
Now you can literally order one
of these things from a company,
and a growing
number of people are
using CGMs to monitor
their glucose, that
is their blood glucose
sometimes referred
to as their blood sugar
level, on a continuous basis.
This is done very easily.
The CGM is typically
a round patch,
sticker-type thing you put
it on the back of your arm.
It has a little tiny needle
that goes painlessly,
I promise painlessly.
I've done these.
I've used them, and
it is truly painless.
It goes into the skin
and then can beautifully
measure glucose
levels, blood sugar
levels in your bloodstream
continuously around the clock.
And you get the data, that is
you get your blood sugar level,
by taking your phone
and scanning it
over the CGM on the
back of your arm
that uploads a
few hours of data.
And so you might do that
three or four times a day,
or you could even
do it once a day,
and it can download
all the data at once.
What you end up with is a
chart readout, so a line graph
literally, by hour of what
your blood glucose level was,
and you then can match
that to your meal intake,
your exercise,
whether or not you
go in a sauna or cold plunge, if
you're into that sort of thing.
Believe it or not,
going into the sauna
will spike your
blood glucose level.
I noticed that when I used
the CGM because if you think
about it when you lose
water, your concentration
of sugar in your bloodstream
is going to increase.
This is easily remedied
by hydrating in the sauna
or by rehydrating after
leaving the sauna.
So you get that sort
of information back.
Perhaps most
importantly, you get
to see how specific foods,
meals, exercise, sleep,
lack of sleep and
their combinations
impact your blood glucose level.
So the first specific question
about CGMs is the following,
are continuous glucose
monitors helpful for those
who are not diabetic?
And the short answer to that
is yes, I do believe they are.
And as I mentioned before,
these were initially
designed for diabetics.
Of course, there are
multiple types of diabetes.
The most typical
is the one where
people do not make insulin
so-called type 1 diabetes.
Those people need
to take insulin.
They actually have
to inject insulin.
Sometimes they'll have
an insulin implant
that will continuously
release insulin as needed.
Nowadays that's more common.
Those folks definitely need
to monitor their blood sugar,
their blood glucose
because they are
at great risk of having
their blood glucose level way
too high or way too low.
And just to make a
long story short,
whether you are a diabetic
or you are nondiabetic,
you do not want
your blood glucose
to be too high or too low.
You don't want to
be hypoglycemic,
as it's called if your
blood sugar is too high,
or hypoglycemic,
blood sugar too low.
The reason is not
only does it make
you feel miserable to be
hypoglycemic, if you become
hypoglycemic, you
actually can kill cells
in particular
neurons, nerve cells.
The range of blood sugar
that neurons can tolerate
is fairly narrow.
Fortunately, your body has
this incredible system,
which involves insulin, which
acts as a chaperone more
or less, to ensure that blood
sugar levels don't go too
high or too low for too long.
Being hypoglycemic can
be a little bit safer,
but your brain
doesn't function well,
you don't feel well when
you are hypoglycemic.
And so you don't want to
be hyper or hypoglycemic.
So for the diabetic or
I should say the type 1
diabetic, who
doesn't make insulin,
this is a life or death issue.
For the more
typical person, this
is not going to
be a life or death
issue because you make insulin.
However, many people are
so-called insulin resistant
or mildly insulin resistant.
Sometimes also called
insulin insensitive.
I really need to
enunciate here that being
insulin insensitive
and insulin resistant
are more or less the same thing.
Mechanistically they're not but
from a practical standpoint,
they are.
The goal for everybody is
to be insulin sensitive,
that is for your cells to
be sensitive to insulin
such that blood sugar
can be regulated properly
and insulin can move
in and out of cells,
and your blood sugar can
be utilized in the ways
that it needs to be
utilized without making you
hypoglycemic or hypoglycemic.
Being insulin
insensitive is associated
with all sorts of things
that are nowadays just thrown
under the umbrella
of metabolic disease,
but things like obesity but
also diminished brain function.
There's now fairly good evidence
that being insulin insensitive
can lead to a more accelerated
dementia, cardiovascular risk,
and on and on and on.
So you don't want that.
So the question was, if
you are not diabetic,
so if you do not have type 1
diabetes where you don't make
insulin, or type
2 diabetes, which
is being insulin insensitive
or insulin resistant,
is a CGM still useful?
And as I already told
you, yes, indeed it is.
And not just
because it gives you
information about
what your blood sugar
levels are relative to certain
meals and exercise, et cetera.
It's because as
far as I know, it
is the only way that you can
determine how specific foods
and behaviors and
their combinations
impact your blood sugar
levels, and then correlate that
with your subjective feelings
of well-being or lack thereof.
So this is really critical
because a lot of people
will eat a meal, and then
feel tired an hour later,
and wonder whether or not it
was some specific component
of that meal.
So if you have a CGM, you can
start to be your own scientist.
You can ask whether or
not you include, say,
a bit more fat in
that meal perhaps
to slow the rate of
absorption of some
of the sugars or
carbohydrates that
might have been in that meal.
Or if you have a higher-protein,
lower-carbohydrate meal,
or if you have a pure-fat meal.
Believe it or not,
people will do this.
They'll just have what's
called a handful of almonds
or something like that.
That's a pure-fat meal.
I realize there are other
macronutrients in there,
but it's mostly fat.
You can see how that impacts
your blood sugar levels,
and then you can correlate
that with how you feel.
There's really no experiment
or physician-type visit
that can give you that kind of
rich and detailed information
that's highly
individualized to you.
So for instance, if you go in to
the doctor to take your fasting
blood glucose level.
This is a fairly
common procedure.
They'll say don't eat or drink
anything prior to coming in.
Ideally, you don't even
have any coffee or tea
as you come into the
clinic in the morning
having fasted for at least 12
and ideally more like 14 hours.
And if your blood sugar level
is 99 milligrams per deciliter
or lower, they're going to
tell you you're quote unquote,
"normal" or in "normal range."
If it's 100 to 125
milligrams per deciliter,
they're going to say, hey,
you might have prediabetes,
or you're looking like
you have prediabetes.
You might be insulin resistant.
You might be
insulin insensitive,
and you might want to do certain
things, in particular increase
your level of exercise,
reduce your calories.
These are the
typical prescriptions
that you'll get from your
physician to try and bring
that number down.
And here we're only talking
about resting blood glucose.
We're not talking about
postmeal blood glucose levels.
And then if your blood
glucose levels first thing
in the morning after
fasting were 126 milligrams
per deciliter or higher,
they're going to tell you,
you have diabetes.
So that sort of
information, of course,
can be incredibly useful, but
that's the sort of information
that you can get from
a CGM every single day,
or at least for the duration
that you wear the CGM.
And the typical duration
that you'll wear or CGM
is for about two weeks, so
it's an experiment of sorts.
As far as I know people aren't
wearing these all year long.
I suppose you could.
These commercially
available devices
contain several patches, so you
can wear them multiple times
throughout the year.
But typically, they're
worn for two weeks.
You glean a lot of data and
information specific to you
and your preferences and
your particular lifestyle,
and then you stop wearing it.
And then you might wear
it again in a few months
after making some
adjustments if you feel
you need those adjustments.
The next part of the question
is, how can wearing this device
help you achieve
better health including
helping your sleep cycle?
Well, this is a really
important question
because it really points to what
you can do with the information
that you get back from your CGM.
I just mentioned what you could
do vis-á-vis food and food
changes, and again,
this is always
going to have to be correlated
with your subjective
experience.
Let me give one more example
before I answer the question
about sleep specifically.
Let's say that
you've been eating
the same type of breakfast
for years and you feel fine.
So I can give myself
as an example.
I tend to eat my first meal of
the day somewhere around 11:00
AM or 12 noon.
That's because I like
to train in the morning,
and I'm not particularly
hungry after that
unless I've trained very hard.
So for me, that
first meal typically
comes around 11 or noon.
And prior to that, I'll
have water and caffeine
of various kinds.
That first meal for
me is almost always
a higher protein plus some
salad or some fibrous vegetable,
maybe a piece of fruit, lower
starchy carbohydrate type meal,
unless I did hard resistance
training earlier that morning,
in which case, I include
some rice or maybe some pasta
or some oatmeal or
something of that sort.
That's the typical
pattern for me,
and I feel fine
heading into that meal
and after eating that meal.
Fine meaning I don't get really
sleepy after eating that meal.
So for me my
subjective experience
of feeling fine after
that meal is perfectly
matched by what I'm
seeing on the CGM.
So it provides what I would
just call reassurance.
However, there are times
when I wake up very hungry,
or I finish training
and I'm very hungry,
and so I'll have a more classic
type breakfast, for lack
of a better way to put it.
I'll have a bowl of oatmeal.
I'll have a protein drink.
I'll have some fruit.
And sometimes I'll really
consume a lot of fruit.
I'll do two or three or maybe
even four pieces of fruit.
And I've found using
the CGM that that really
does tend to spike my blood
sugar level quite a bit more.
And the downward
slope after that
meal tends to be far more
gradual than probably I
would prefer, meaning
my blood sugar level
doesn't come back down as
quickly as I would like.
What do I mean as
quickly as I would like?
Well, what I discovered
over the years
subjectively was that
when I have that breakfast
and then I have my more
typical lunch a few hours later
because I tend to
be hungry again
always around 11:00
AM or 12 noon,
then I tend to be very
sleepy in the afternoon.
And when I wore the
CGM, I discovered
that it was the spacing between
those meals that was really
the issue.
It was that that initial
spike in blood glucose
from that first meal
hadn't subsided,
and then I had that
second meal, and then
I'd find myself 2:00 or 3:00
PM just almost bleary eyed
and exhausted and
really needing a nap.
And I'm not somebody
who's opposed
to taking a nap
each day provided
it's 90 minutes or less.
This is what the circadian
science data tell us
that if you are going to
nap during the day, great.
If you don't want to
nap, that's fine too.
As long as it doesn't interfere
with your nighttime sleep,
fine to take a nap.
Just keep it 90 minutes
or less or do something
like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
which you can find on YouTube.
Just put NSDR and my name.
Or take a more traditional nap.
However, I was really
suffering from lack of energy
in the afternoon when these two
meals were too close together.
So I just made the
simple adjustment
of if I need to eat something
shortly after training,
I try and keep that meal
a little bit smaller.
I reduce the amount of fruit
in that meal a little bit.
And I add an extra hour
between the next meal.
So if that first meal
came at say, 9:30 AM,
rather than eat what would
normally be my first meal,
let's just call it my lunch
in this case at 11:00 AM or 12
noon, I'll push
that out to 1:00 PM.
And then I felt
great all afternoon.
So this might seem
like a trivial example,
but the CGM really informed me
as to why this was happening.
I was getting a collision
of blood glucose levels
early in the day, and then a
sharper drop in the afternoon.
So by spacing out my
meals a little bit more,
I felt much better.
My training actually improved,
which is a little bit
counterintuitive.
You might think, oh, you're
not eating soon enough
after training, your training
is going to get worse.
It actually improved.
My afternoon focus for cognitive
work improved, et cetera.
And I actually answered this
question starting this way
because the question was
specifically about sleep.
What I also found was because
all I needed in the afternoon
was maybe a short 10-minute
minute or 30-minute NSDR
and I wasn't taking
a longer nap,
I found that then my sleep
that night was far better.
And in fact, I think that's
one of the best uses of CGMs
for diabetics and
nondiabetics alike,
which is that you can figure
out how your meal schedule
and content impacts your sleep.
So dinner for me almost
always at sometime
between 6:30 and 7:30 PM.
I'm not super strict about
the exact timing of that.
And as I've mentioned
before on the podcast,
my evening meal or
let's just call it
my dinner is typically higher
in carbohydrates than my earlier
day meal, a little
bit lower in protein.
It does include vegetables
and things of that sort
because I'm an omnivore.
It Does include some
protein, but it's
more carbohydrate rich.
It's not carbohydrate heavy.
I'm not eating tons and
tons of carbohydrates.
I'm not carbohydrate loading
for some big endurance event
or something that sort.
But includes rice or pasta
and things of that sort.
And by keeping that meal
restricted more or less to 6:30
to 7:30, what I
find is I can still
have a snack later that evening
if I'm a little bit hungry,
and then fall asleep easily
and sleep very deeply
throughout the night.
However, if that meal comes
too late in the day, say, 8:30,
9:30, 10:00, I do find
that disrupts my sleep.
And I know this because I
track my sleep nowadays.
I use either WHOOP or Eat
Sleep or both in order
to track my sleep.
But the subjective feeling
of sleep is always matched,
I would say, inversely by how
close that meal comes to sleep.
Put into plain English
what I'm saying
is if I eat too close to
bedtime, my sleep isn't great.
So you could say, well, couldn't
you get that information
in the absence of a CGM?
Yes, you absolutely could.
Of course, it's
subjective so you don't
need any type of measurement.
But what I was able
to parse and what
you'll be able to parse if
you do decide to use a CGM
is you can figure out
how specific contents
of the evening meal are
impacting your sleep.
So for instance, in
my case, it really
made sense to keep the
carbohydrate levels
sufficiently high in
that evening meal.
Again, not a huge
meal of carbohydrates
but to make sure I
was getting enough
carbohydrates that I could
fall asleep pretty easily
and stay asleep a
few hours later.
My typical bed time is somewhere
between 10:00 and 11:30 PM.
I'd like to say it's
always 10:00 PM,
but more typically I get into
bed around 9:30 or 10:00.
And then I'm usually
asleep somewhere
between 10:30 and 11:30.
So to be a bit more direct
about the question of
whether or not CGM
can help with sleep,
it's not a tool to manipulate
sleep to help you fall asleep
faster, it's a tool to help you
manipulate the variables that
can impact your sleep
in real ways, food just
being one of them.
So I already mentioned that
I do my physical training
early in the day.
If I can I like to train some
time between 7:00 and 8:00 AM,
or 7:00 and 8:30.
I like to have my
physical training done
by 9:00 AM if possible.
But some days I can't do
that because of meetings
and scheduling, or I need
a little bit more sleep
and so I'll sleep in
the morning sometimes
if I didn't get a good night's
sleep for whatever reason.
In which case, I will
exercise in the afternoon.
And then I'm very
careful to avoid
ingesting too much
caffeine, or ideally, I
don't take any caffeine
into my system after 2:00 PM
to do a run or resistance
training in the afternoon.
For me it's very rare to
do any kind of training
in the afternoon because I
like to train caffeinated,
and it can really disrupt
sleep to be caffeinated.
So if you're somebody who
can't train early in the day--
and I do believe
people should do
resistance or cardiovascular
exercise at least five
and probably more
like six days a week
for their overall health.
The data will support that.
If you're going to
exercise later in the day,
you want to make sure
that's not disrupting
your sleep because
exercise increases
your body temperature.
Typically, that's not going
to be good for falling asleep.
Some people will sleep
great after exercising.
However, with the
CGM what you can
see is how exercise,
caffeinated or noncaffeinated,
is impacting your
blood sugar levels
and how what you eat after
training, because most
people do ingest some
calories after their training,
is impacting your blood sugar
levels and then your sleep.
In fact, what you
can see over time
is that most people do well
by having their blood sugar
level fairly stable
or slightly dropping
at the time in which they
want to get to sleep.
Just like you want
your body temperature
dropping by about
1 to 3 degrees,
having your blood
sugar level starting
to taper down or at least
be stable in the two hours
or so prior to sleep is going
to be best for getting your best
sleep that night.
So the short answer is
yes, CGMs can really
help you parse all the
variables that can really
nail down your sleep cycle.
So as I describe for me how
I was eating early in the day
was impacting my afternoon
feelings of alertness or lack
thereof, in this
case, and then that
was impacting my
nighttime sleep.
So with CGMs you
can really start
to see how the different
aspects of your life
interact and domino
with one another.
So it is not a
perfect experiment,
but it does provide really
nice quantitative data that you
can address across days.
And I think that's one of
the real values of CGMs
is that you can really compare
not just a fasted blood
glucose in one doctor's
visit to the next,
or if you were to
come into a laboratory
and do an experiment
where they're measuring
your glucose maybe
for eight hours
would be the most you'd
ever get the readout for.
The laboratory staff
have to go home.
I know this because
I run a laboratory,
and we do experiments on humans.
Staff have to go home.
With CGMs, you're getting
data around the clock
for several weeks on end.
So that can be very,
very beneficial.
The third part of
the question is,
can you discuss ranges
that are considered healthy
and whether there are data for
nondiabetic people using CGMs
as a wellness and health tool?
Yes, I can.
The value, as I
mentioned earlier,
for your fasting that is
morning blood glucose having
not eaten anything
for 12 to 14 hours
prior that doctors
are looking for
is 99 milligrams per
deciliter or lower.
Now keep in mind if you don't
sleep well, or believe it
or not, even if you are down
just one hour of sleep prior
to taking that morning
fasting blood glucose reading,
that reading is going to be
quite a bit higher than it
normally would be for you.
It won't necessarily be
higher than 99% milligrams
per deciliter, but it
can be as much as 10%
or even 20% higher than normal.
So this speaks to the
critical relationship
between sleep and fasting
or resting blood glucose
as it's sometimes called.
I suppose resting can be
between meals as well,
so I'll be very
specific and say fasting
blood glucose should be 99
milligrams per deciliter
or lower.
When you eat, you are going
to increase your blood sugar
level.
And I think this is a really
important point for people
to hear that spikes
in blood glucose
are not necessarily bad.
Everyone experiences
spikes in blood glucose
when they eat something.
If you just have a handful of
almonds, so it's mostly fat,
no sugar, very little
protein frankly,
you're not going to see a big
increase in blood glucose.
If you just have a
steak, you're not
going to see much
increase in blood glucose.
If you have some
broccoli, you're
not going to see a big
increase in blood glucose.
If you have a bowl
of white rice,
you're going to see a big
increase in blood glucose.
So you're starting to
get the logic here.
But the typical values
that physicians want to see
is that during a
meal, you really
don't want your blood
glucose level to get way up
into the high 200 ideally.
Keep in mind that regardless
of macronutrient content,
if you eat a very
large meal, you're
going to increase your
blood glucose level.
Of course, there are
exceptions to that.
If you eat a massive
caldron full of broccoli,
you're not going to spike
your blood glucose that much.
You probably just spike your
gastric distress instead.
But the idea is that
spikes in blood glucose
are not necessarily bad if you
have normal insulin function
and normal insulin sensitivity.
Your insulin will bring that
blood glucose back down.
It's not going to be a problem.
And in fact, sometimes
after doing a hard workout,
resistance training, or high
intensity interval training,
it makes sense actually to
spike your blood glucose a bit
in order to replenish your
glycogen a bit more quickly.
You don't have to, but it
will accelerate the process.
Physicians want to see that two
hours after the start of a meal
your blood glucose level is
less than 180, 180 milligrams
per deciliter.
They want to see it
below that number.
So with the CGM,
you can really start
to see how your fasting
blood glucose in the morning
will vary depending
on your sleep.
You'll start to see
how your resting blood
glucose between meals
changes depending on
whether or not you're
eating your meals three
or four or eight hours apart.
You can see how it changes
according to your caffeine
intake, use of the sauna for
reasons I mentioned earlier,
exercise, and on and on.
In fact, you can even
get a window into how
and more what typically
considered mundane activities
like how much walking you
did, or sitting you did,
or whether or not you travel
that day, how that can impact
your blood glucose level.
So to summarize,
I think the best
use of CGMs for
nondiabetics is really
as a detailed,
multivariable, highly
individualized experiment that
you get to run on yourself.
And so for those of
you that are really
interested in
understanding your health
and how the different variables
of exercise, and food,
and lifestyle, et
cetera, even emotions,
and mood, and stress, how those
impact your blood glucose--
and perhaps you can run the
correlation the other way.
How your blood
glucose correlates
with your levels of stress
or calm, et cetera, well,
then I think it's
a terrific tool,
and you certainly don't have
to be diabetic to derive
a lot of benefit from one.
The next question is about
modifying human behavior
not our own but other peoples.
So the question is, how
can I build good habits
alongside a partner
who challenges them?
And the question also
ventures into how
to encourage one's
partner to adopt
positive behavioral change?
Well, I'm not here to
settle or exacerbate
any couples disputes
or family disputes,
but I'll try nonetheless.
Let's keep in mind one
of the basic principles
of neurobiology which
is that your brain is
very plastic, that is it can
be changed in response to even
passive experience from about
birth until about age 25.
That is for better
and for worse.
For better because if you're
exposed to music in the home
and you play an
instrument, well, you're
going to have some music
ability going forward.
If you learn how to
ride a bicycle and swim,
you'll likely be able to
do that your entire life.
And if you grow
up in a home where
there are certain discussions
and emotional tone,
that can be great or
that can be terrible.
So for better or for worse.
In fact, much of
our work as adults
is to reexamine the
components within us that
were wired into us by way
of nurture that are not
adaptive for us and to try and
adjust those in healthy ways.
From age about 25, again,
these aren't strict cutoffs,
until whatever
age it is that you
live to until you
die, which I hope is
a ripe, old, healthy
age, neuroplasticity
is still possible.
You can still learn.
You can still modify your
nervous system for the better,
but it requires a
couple of things.
It requires attention to
what you want to change.
You really have to focus
much harder than you
did when you were younger.
That's clear.
And you need rest, you
need sleep in order
for the rewiring to
occur because that's
when the actual changes occur.
I should mention for young
children and teens and people
in their 20s, you also
need the rest part
for the rewiring to occur.
It's just that the stimulus for
rewiring your nervous system
can be a passive one, it
can be mere experience.
This question asks, how can we
change when our partner doesn't
approve of or is disparaging
of our attempts to change,
and how can we get them to
want to adopt healthy change?
Well, let's go back
to neuroplasticity.
If your partner is
25 years or older,
they have to be the one
to direct the change.
The only type of positive
nervous system change
that can occur at that stage of
life is when it's from within.
That's why we call
it self-directed
adaptive plasticity.
Now, of course, there's
lifelong plasticity from birth
until death that's maladaptive.
So a brain injury will
create plasticity,
but it's generally not the
kind of plasticity people
are interested in.
So the specific
question is, quote,
"I have been trying to
incorporate a lot of advice
from your podcast
into my daily routine,
but I have a partner who
thinks I'm overly OCD--" here
we go again, OCD--
"about these protocols
and isn't bought in.
How do you manage your own
ambitions, goals, and routines
around others who aren't
as attuned to the impact
of their lifestyle choices?"
OK, well, there is a lot here.
First of all, I don't disparage
the use of OCD in this case,
but again, we want to
really be clear that what
this person is referring to
is probably not true OCD.
OCD being this psychiatric
disorder, very intrusive
thoughts, compulsions
that are also intrusive,
washing hands to the
point of them being raw,
engaging in behaviors
of any kind that
disrupt normal
functioning and that
don't relieve the obsessions.
So here I think we
should replace OCD.
And the question
was with quote, "I
have a partner who thinks
I am overly focused
on these protocols
and isn't bought in."
OK, well, this is a
tricky question to answer,
but I think we can do it if
we take a step back, look
at that basic principle
of neurobiology, which
is absolutely true and has
been true since the beginning
of time, which is that
if your partner is not
interested in changing, they
are not going to change.
They're just simply not.
Now, you could introduce
punishments or rewards
to try and inspire
change, but they
are going to have to
self-direct those changes.
How you get somebody to adopt
a change that they don't want,
or a mode of thinking or
engaging in the world in a way
that they don't want if they
are not your child, well,
assuming this is a healthy
consensual relationship,
there really is none
except by way of example.
And I should note that
sometimes the example
of one partner in a
relationship embracing
positive behavioral change
and health changes, et cetera
improves the relationship,
and sometimes it
makes it worse even much worse.
This relates actually
to a conversation
that I had with Dr. David
Buss, professor of psychology
at the University
of Texas, Austin
where he talked about
what's called mate value.
Mate value is not just
present in the courting phase
where people are trying
to assess whether or not
someone would be a good
partner for them or not
along a number of
different criteria
but also within a relationship.
And he also talked
about the fact
that one not kind in fact
very destructive tactic
that individuals within a
couple or romantic relationship
will employ sometimes is to try
and lower their partner's mate
value to ensure that they
can't end up with anybody else
and really try and
harm their self-esteem,
make them feel bad about
themselves physically
or emotionally.
Unfortunately, this is
pretty common, especially
when one of the partners
has these components
of what Dr. Buss
referred to as the dark
triad so Machiavellian.
And sometimes people call
these people narcissists,
and sometimes they
are, sometimes
they're not narcissists, but
they have sociopathic tones.
They aren't necessarily
violent, although they can be.
But these are people who really
try and make their partner
feel lousy about themselves
so that their partner doesn't
consider leaving
the relationship
because their partner starts
to feel as if they wouldn't
have the option to leave.
Now, that's a
pretty dark picture.
I don't think the person asking
this question is necessarily
alluding to that
kind of dynamic.
However, this notion
of perceived mate value
and self-perceived value
is a prominent feature
in all relationships.
Healthy relationships
people want
to see the other person in
their relationship doing well,
and they feel better
as a consequence
of their partner doing
well, and they feel good
about themselves.
And that's a healthy esteem
in psychology, but, of course,
that's not always present.
So oftentimes when
one partner decides
that they're going to start
embracing a lot of tools that
allow them to have more
energy, perhaps make
some aesthetic changes that
they feel are positive for them,
et cetera, the other partner
gets nervous about that
and will use some of these
tactics of being disparaging
of those very behaviors.
However, we also
have to acknowledge
that when individuals
in a relationship
start engaging in new
behaviors of any kind that
make the other person feel a
bit more isolated, well, then
oftentimes that's because
they're getting less time
with that person, et cetera.
So in a practical sense, we can
only control our own behavior.
But if you care about the
relationship obviously,
one of the kind things to do
is to be very inviting in terms
of I'll just use examples of
protocols typical to the sort
that I describe in the podcast.
So for example, if you're
going to go outside
to get sunlight in your
eyes in the morning,
especially on cloudy days as
much sunlight as possible,
you can invite the other
person to go with you.
I would hope you would.
If they say no, then you can go.
I still think it's
very important,
but you can encourage them
to come along with you.
You perhaps can talk to
them about other things
that they enjoy as
opposed to telling them
all the virtues of
looking at sunlight
and maybe just let them
experience the benefits
at first.
And then here we're
getting a little bit
into couple psychology, and
I'm not a licensed couples
therapist, but we're
really talking about here
is behavioral change.
Families with children
oftentimes do this.
I'm very familiar with this.
Bringing the kids
outside for breakfast
or having a cup of coffee while
the kids have their whatever,
cocoa, or whatever it is
they have in the morning milk
outside to get their
sunlight exposure.
In other words, people
don't necessarily
need to be aware of all
the underlying mechanisms
and benefits in order to
derive those benefits.
That's a wonderful feature
of these tools that
are grounded in biology because
they work the first time
and they work every time.
You don't necessarily
need the full description
of how they work.
Although I do believe once
you understand mechanism,
it really serves to reinforce
the specifics of the protocol.
It gives you flexibility
around the protocols.
So being inviting
about those protocols
can be very beneficial.
When it comes to
things like exercise,
that's a little bit trickier.
I actually have friends
in which there's
a pretty vast divergence
inside of their relationships
where one is really into
exercise and the other one
not so much.
Or one really likes to walk
and the other loves to run.
Well, then it's going to be
difficult to try and merge
those activities.
However, in the episode that
I did on optimal fitness,
I describe a schedule
whereby, for instance, I
do a very long, well, long for
me, hour to hour and a half,
sometimes even a two-hour
jog on Sundays or a hike.
And I much prefer to do that
hike with family members.
And because some of them
hike a lot slower than I do,
some of them more quickly
but slower than I do,
I'll throw on a weight vest
or something like that.
I don't make a big deal
or production of it
or point it out.
I just do that to ensure
that I get enough work.
It's a real exercise for me, but
I'm socializing the whole time.
So my suggestion
is to try and bring
family members into the
protocols but in a way
that isn't talking down
to them and actually quite
the opposite.
In a way that
really acknowledges
what their interests are and
why they might want to do it.
And see whether or
not it catches or not,
whether or not they're
interested in it
and then doing it on their
own when you're not there.
That would be the ultimate
test of whether or not
they've really
adopted the protocols.
So there are ways to create
bridges around this stuff,
but frankly, if
somebody is really
resistant to doing
exercise, or changing
eating habits, or
drinking less alcohol,
or getting morning
sunlight, it's
going to be very difficult
for you to quote unquote,
"convince them".
And using tactics like
punishment and reward
certainly work,
but I don't think
those are going to be the
best tactics going forward.
So I encourage people to take
a look at the situation they're
in, assess it clearly.
Perhaps talk to the other
person about why they think
these things can be beneficial.
But I also am very, very
sensitive to the fact
that when one individual of a
family or several individuals
in a family are really
excited about something
and other people are not
or are resistant to it,
trying to get the
other people on board
has to be done very tactfully.
And you just want to
be mindful of the fact
that for people that
haven't been exposed
to the mechanisms and
the health benefits
and haven't experienced
them for themselves,
it's like talking to somebody
in a foreign language
that they don't understand.
It's going to feel
very foreign to them,
and it's going to be
very hard for them
to understand why they would
want to approach it at all.
So one would hope
that people maintain
a certain level of open
mindedness throughout life.
But then again, we are
all guilty of having
our particular closed-minded
aspects of our psychology.
So I do appreciate the
question because what
I hear beneath the question
is that this person is
very excited about the
routines and protocols
that they've felt have benefited
their health that they've
derived from the podcast
and that they want others
to experience them as well.
So for that matter,
any time you want
to teach a protocol that
you've learned on the podcast
or share it, please do.
I always say I don't hold the
patent to these protocols.
These are protocols
that are derived
from biological mechanisms
that are hardwired into us,
so they work the first
time, they work every time.
They require a little
bit of education
about how to apply them.
But as you share and
distribute protocols,
do keep in mind that people
are going to feel differently
about them and about the
whole notion of self-care.
And this gets into a deep vessel
of issues around psychology
and health that I hope
to address in the series
that we have coming up
on mental health, which
is what are the first
principles of self-care?
For some people,
believe it or not,
exercise and eating well
is not viewed as positive.
They actually view
that as selfish.
A number of people
grow up in families
where that idea is reinforced.
For other people not
exercising and not eating well
is considered
selfish because you
are quote unquote,
"laboring people
with taking care of you
when you're not well,
which happens more frequently."
So there is a lot of
discrepancy around these ideas.
And right now is a
very dynamic time.
Not just in the United States
but around the world in terms
of what is real health, and
how do we perceive and take
care of our own health
and the health of others.
So this is a big topic, and it's
one that really gets heavily
into psychology
and mental health,
and it is something
that we will address
in more detail in the
mental health series.
But meanwhile, I do
want to remind everybody
that from birth to 25
and still from 25 onward,
your nervous system
is very malleable.
It's very plastic.
So by adopting behavioral
change and by adopting
psychological change, you
can really modify the way
that your nervous
system works so
that viewing morning sunlight,
getting regular exercise,
hydrating well, eating well,
quality social connection,
et cetera, can all be
strongly reinforced
and become a seamless
part of your overall day.
And not diminish your
productivity and the quality
of your relationships,
but rather
to bolster your
productivity and the quality
of your relationships.
The next question is
about naps versus NSDR
or non-sleep deep rest.
The question is, what is more
efficient to replenish energy
and dopamine levels
during the day,
taking a short nap of about
20 minutes or NSDR a.k.a.
yoga nidra of about 20 minutes?
This is an excellent question.
And for those of you that
aren't familiar with NSDR
or non-sleep deep rest,
non-sleep deep rest
is an acronym and term that I
coined because it encompasses
a certain type of
behavioral protocol
that has been shown in
the research literature
to be very effective
at restoring energy
and to do that by
way of restoring
dopamine levels in these very
short behavioral practices.
So just as a brief but
very important aside,
mindfulness meditation, so
sitting or lying down with eyes
closed focusing your attention
on your third eye center
and/or your breathing for
anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes,
is really a focus exercise.
It's known to
improve your ability
to focus outside
of that meditation.
It's known to improve memory,
in particular working memory,
which is where you have to
keep certain thoughts online.
Someone tells you a number
or a set of directions
on the street, it's
the kind of thing
that you're likely to
forget in a couple of days,
but you need to remember
for a few seconds
or minutes or maybe even an
hour, that's working memory.
Mindfulness meditation
has also been
shown to reduce stress levels.
And studies from
my laboratory and
many, many other laboratories
prior to my lab showing that.
And mindfulness
meditation has also
been shown to reveal certain
levels of insight, that
is people's ability to
realize certain things
about their patterns of
thinking and emotions
and relationship
with others and self
that they aren't able
to realize outside
of mindfulness meditation.
And of course, there
is the whole category
of mindfulness
meditation that extends
into longer more repeated
meditations, silent meditation
retreats, and so on that get
into realms of consciousness
and one's ability to perceive
one's own consciousness,
those sort of
higher order things.
But for sake of this discussion,
brief meaning 5 to 10
and maybe 20-minute
meditations are
known to improve one's
ability to focus,
even if they're done
semi-irregularly, so even
two or three times a week.
So it doesn't have to
even be every single day.
Breathwork of the sorts
that I've talked about
before on the podcast,
so either box breathing
meaning inhale, hold, exhale,
hold, repeat of a given
duration, maybe 4-seconds
inhale, 4-seconds hold,
4-seconds exhale, 4-seconds
hold, and then repeat.
Or so-called cyclic sighing,
which I've talked about.
Double inhale through the nose
to really maximally inflate
your lungs, and then long
exhale through the mouth.
That's a single
physiological sigh.
It looks like this
[INHALING]
[EXHALING]
One of those will rapidly
distress you but done
repeatedly for about
5 minutes, data
from my laboratory
in collaboration
with Dr. David Spiegel's
laboratory from Stanford
School of Medicine has
shown that that is perhaps
the most effective
protocol if done 5 minutes
a day to improve mood, improve
sleep, lower resting heart
rate, reduce stress, et cetera.
Other forms of
breathwork include things
like cyclic hyperventilation.
[HYPERVENTILATING]
So for those of you
listening and not watching,
I'm just inhaling
deeply through the nose
and then passively
exhaling through the mouth
on repeat for 25 breaths or so.
Pausing with lungs empty.
Holding one's breath for
about 15 to 30 seconds
then repeating.
That's shown to increase levels
of attention and alertness
during the breathing
protocol, but then
reduce levels of stress
afterwards not as much
as cyclic sighing, but that's
an effective protocol as well.
And there are other
breathwork protocols.
We can really just wrap
a bow around breathwork,
and say that
breathwork is designed
to shift one's state to either
more alert or less alert
overall.
And typically when
inhales are more vigorous
and of longer
duration than exhales,
our level of attention
alertness goes up.
When our exhales are active and
more deliberate and lengthen
compared to inhales within
the breathing protocol,
it tends to be a stress
reducing protocol.
So mindfulness meditation
is a focus exercise.
Breathwork is a way to shift
one's state deliberately
both during the protocol
and around the clock.
There are good data
to support that.
Hypnosis-- and when
I say hypnosis,
I mean self-directed
hypnosis of the sort
that you'll find
on the Reveri app,
and this was discussed
in the episode
that I did with
Dr. David Spiegel.
And you can find that
at hubermanlab.com.
You can even go on to YouTube
and put in Huberman Spiegel
hypnosis, and you'll
see that episode.
You'll also see a short
clip from that episode
if you like where Dr.
Spiegel hypnotizes me.
Hypnosis of the kind
that I'm referring to
is very different
than stage hypnosis
because it is guided
but self-directed.
What do I mean by that?
Well, it's designed to
resolve a specific problem.
Hypnosis brings
the brain and body
into a state of
accelerated neuroplasticity
and is designed to resolve a
certain problem like get better
at sleeping, resolve
anxiety, resolve a trauma,
change some pattern of
behavior or thinking.
So in the way I'm
describing it here,
meditation is to improve focus.
Breathwork is designed to shift
your state, more alert or less
alert depending
on what you want.
Hypnosis is designed to
solve a specific problem.
And then there is NSDR
or non-sleep deep rest
which is in some sense a
renaming of yoga nidra.
I do acknowledge that.
But it's different
than yoga nidra which
means yoga sleep or yoga rest.
Because yoga nidra
involves intentions
said or self-stated
in one's mind
during the yoga nidra practice.
NDSR is really a
combination body scan,
exhale-emphasized breathing,
and a few other aspects
that bring the brain and body
into a state of deep relaxation
that is very similar,
believe it or not,
to rapid eye movement sleep.
So this is a conscious
sleep like state
that we know can increase
dopamine levels by about 65%
even through a very
short NSDR practice.
And in doing so, it can also
replenish focus and alertness
and energy.
So just to summarize,
meditation is to improve focus.
Breathwork is to
shift one's state.
Self-directed
hypnosis of the sort
that is done in
Reveri app, et cetera
is to solve a particular problem
or change one's nervous system
in a particular way.
And NSDR or non-sleep
deep rest or yoga nidra
are designed to replenish
our levels of energy
by way of increasing
our levels of dopamine.
So that's hopefully
clear to everyone now.
And the question
was, what's more
efficient to replenish
energy and dopamine
levels during the day,
short naps or NSDR?
So then we have to ask
ourselves, what is a short nap?
So a short nap of
20 minutes per day
or even up to 90
minutes per day is going
to be fine for most people.
Many people, however, find that
if they nap during the day,
they can't sleep well at night.
So if you are somebody who finds
that if you nap during the day
and as a consequence
can't sleep well at night
or can't fall asleep
when you want to,
please don't nap during the day.
Abstain from naps.
Do NSDR instead.
If you are somebody
who naps during the day
and wakes up very
groggy from those naps,
I'm raising my hand for
those of you just listening.
I'm raising my hand because
I am one such person.
I am not a moody person.
I think most people
in my life would
agree with that statement.
But if I take a nap of about 20
or 30 minutes in the afternoon,
about 2/3 of the time
I wake up feeling
really out of it and a
little bit grumpy, which
is unusual for me.
Keep your nap shorter
than 90 minutes.
I should also say you
do not have to nap.
So people out there who
don't like naps, don't nap.
It's not a problem.
You don't have to nap.
People who love
naps, great, nap.
But keep them shorter
than 90 minutes.
And the 20-minute nap
or so-called power nap
is a great tool
for a lot of people
to replenish levels
of energy and focus,
especially done in
the early afternoon.
If you had to pick between
taking a short nap of about
20 minutes or doing
20 minutes of NSDR,
I would suggest doing NSDR
for the following reasons.
NSDR but not short
naps have been
shown to replenish
dopamine levels and energy.
So it accomplishes much
of what one is trying
to accomplish by taking a nap.
NSDR also has
additional benefits
such as because you
are deliberately
trying to stay awake
but very relaxed
during the NSDR protocol, you
learn to consciously control
your so-called parasympathetic
nervous system which
is the arm of your
autonomic nervous system
that causes deep relaxation
both of the musculature,
but also allows you to learn
to deliberately slow down
your thinking and even
fragment your thinking,
which is what's required to
fall asleep at night easily.
So there aren't a
lot of clinical data
on this just yet, although
they are emerging.
But from what we do know
from laboratory studies
NSDR can help people get better
at falling asleep at night.
And it's a wonderful tool for
falling back asleep if you wake
up in the middle of the night
and you're having a hard time
getting back to sleep.
So if we were to line them
up right next to each other,
we'd say are 20-minute
naps more or less
restorative than 20-minute NSDR?
You'd say probably
about the same.
If we were to compare NSDR
and naps for their ability
to increase dopamine,
we'd say NSDR is superior
based on the data
that are published
at this point in time.
And if we were to compare
naps of 20 minutes
to NSDR of 20 minutes
for their ability
to improve one's ability
to self-direct relaxation
and improve one's
ability to fall asleep
either at the
beginning of the night
or in the middle of the
night if one wakes up,
well, then we would
again say that NSDR
is known to outperform naps
in terms of that as well.
So to answer the
question directly,
what is more efficient to
replenish energy and dopamine
levels during the day,
short naps or NSDR?
The answer is NSDR.
And there are additional
benefits of NSDR
that naps don't provide.
With all that said, if
you find a 20-minute nap,
or a 30-minute nap,
or even an hour long
nap to be tremendously
restorative for you,
and that's what allows
you to lean back
into the demands of your day
best as compared to NSDR,
then by all means, take
those naps and don't do NSDR.
However, if you're somebody
that doesn't like naps
or that is looking
to obtain some
of these additional benefits
that NSDR can provide,
NSDR is the way to go.
And if you want to access a
zero-cost NSDR that is it's
a little bit shorter.
It's not a 20-minute NSDR,
but it's a 10-minute NSDR,
but it is very effective,
you can go to YouTube.
Simply put my last name
Huberman and then NSDR,
and there's a
zero-cost script there.
There are now other
NSDRs available.
There's some terrific ones on
YouTube read in a female voice
by Kelly Boys is her name.
So you can just put NSDR, and
it's Kelly, K-E-L-L-Y B-O-Y-S.
We don't have any business
affiliation with Kelly,
but she's put out some
really terrific NSDR.
She's a longtime meditation
teacher, et cetera
and has put out some really
terrific NSDRs ranging,
I think, in duration
from about 8 minutes
all the way up to 30 minutes
or perhaps even more.
All of which are 0 cost.
Again, you can find
those on YouTube.
And now they're starting
to be apps out there
that include NSDR
as well, but I think
most people,
including myself, are
interested in the
zero-cost tools that
don't require that I
go back into my phone
yet more during the day.
